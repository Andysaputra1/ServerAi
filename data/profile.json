      "name": "Explore ID",
      "description": "I built a travel discovery web platform using React.js and SQL database integration, developed collaboratively under Scrum Agile methodology with clear task divisions across sprints and weekly stand-up reviews[cite: 20]. This iterative workflow enhanced team efficiency, ensured continuous feature testing, and yielded optimized search performance and a responsive UI/UX design[cite: 21]. The platform enables users to explore destinations easily while promoting local tourism engagement and showcasing practical teamwork and adaptability in real-world project execution[cite: 22].",
      "impact": "ExploreID berpotensi mendorong ekonomi pariwisata dan UMKM melalui rekomendasi personal yang menaikkan belanja wisatawan dan memeratakan kunjungan ke kota non-mainstream, sekaligus membuka lapangan kerja inklusif bagi pemandu lokal (termasuk kelompok rentan) lewat sistem matching, rating, dan micro-credential; di sisi pengguna, itinerary otomatis yang memperhitungkan preferensi, anggaran, mobilitas, dan keamanan meningkatkan kualitas pengalaman (NPS/CSAT, waktu perencanaan lebih singkat) serta menurunkan refund/complaint; dari aspek keberlanjutan, rute efisien dan opsi transport rendah emisi membantu menekan jejak karbon serta mengurangi kepadatan destinasi melalui penyebaran kunjungan; sementara data agregat (heatmap demand, konversi tiket, tren minat) memberi intelijen bagi DMO/pemerintah untuk kampanye yang lebih tepat sasaran; keberhasilan dapat dipantau lewat KPI seperti % transaksi ke UMKM/guide lokal, itinerary completion rate, LOS kota sekunder, adopsi transport publik/EV, dan peningkatan pendapatan median pemandu—sehingga tercapai pariwisata Indonesia yang lebih inklusif, aman, dan berkelanjutan.",
